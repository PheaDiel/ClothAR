- [ ] Verify landmark visualization toggle
- [ ] Check clothing opacity adjustments
- [ ] Confirm settings persist between sessions

#### 4.3 Capture Functionality
- [ ] Test photo capture with AR overlay
- [ ] Verify captured images are saved correctly
- [ ] Check sharing functionality for captured images
- [ ] Confirm capture button disabled during processing

### 5. Performance Testing

#### 5.1 Device Compatibility
- [ ] Test on various iOS devices (iPhone 8 and newer)
- [ ] Test on various Android devices (API level 21+)
- [ ] Verify performance on low-end devices
- [ ] Check battery consumption during AR sessions

#### 5.2 Frame Rate and Responsiveness
- [ ] Monitor frame rate during AR rendering
- [ ] Test UI responsiveness during AR processing
- [ ] Check for lag or stuttering in AR view
- [ ] Verify smooth transitions between screens

### 6. User Experience Testing

#### 6.1 Onboarding and Instructions
- [ ] Verify clear instructions for AR usage
- [ ] Test tutorial or help functionality
- [ ] Check accessibility of all controls
- [ ] Confirm error messages are user-friendly

#### 6.2 Error Handling
- [ ] Test behavior when camera permission is denied
- [ ] Verify handling of unsupported devices
- [ ] Check error messages for network issues
- [ ] Confirm graceful degradation when AR fails
