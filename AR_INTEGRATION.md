# AR Integration for Clothing App

## Overview
This document explains how the AR (Augmented Reality) integration works in the Clothing App and what would be needed to fully implement the virtual try-on functionality.

## Current Implementation
The CameraScreen component has been implemented as a placeholder that shows:
- A title "AR Camera"
- A description of the AR functionality
- Information about how users can try on clothing virtually

## Full AR Implementation Plan

### 1. Camera Functionality
To fully implement AR, we would need to:

1. **Implement Camera Access**:
   - Use `expo-camera` to access the device camera
   - Handle camera permissions properly
   - Implement camera controls (flash, front/back camera toggle)

2. **Body Detection**:
   - Use machine learning models to detect human body landmarks
   - Libraries like `@tensorflow/tfjs` and `@tensorflow-models/blazepose` could be used
   - Detect key body points like shoulders, waist, etc.

3. **3D Clothing Rendering**:
   - Use `three.js` or `react-three-fiber` for 3D rendering
   - Create 3D models of clothing items
   - Map clothing items to detected body landmarks

4. **AR Engine Integration**:
   - Use libraries like `expo-three` to integrate Three.js with Expo
   - Implement AR session management
   - Handle real-time rendering of clothing on the user's body

### 2. Required Dependencies
The following dependencies have already been installed:
- `expo-camera`: For camera access
- `expo-gl`: For WebGL support
- `three`: For 3D rendering
- `expo-three`: For integrating Three.js with Expo

### 3. Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Enhanced Camera Functionality
```typescript
// This would replace the current placeholder implementation
import { Camera, CameraType } from 'expo-camera';

// Implement camera with proper controls
```

#### Step 2: Body Detection
```typescript
// Use TensorFlow.js for body pose detection
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';
import * as poseDetection from '@tensorflow-models/pose-detection';

// Detect body landmarks
const detector = await poseDetection.createDetector(
  poseDetection.SupportedModels.MoveNet
);
```

#### Step 3: 3D Clothing Rendering
```typescript
// Use Three.js for 3D rendering
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { ExpoWebGLRenderingContext, GLView } from 'expo-gl';

// Render clothing on detected body
```

### 4. AR Utility Functions
We've already created utility functions in `src/utils/arUtils.ts` that include:
- `loadModel`: For loading 3D models
- `initializeAR`: For initializing AR sessions
- `detectBodyPose`: For body pose detection (placeholder)
- `renderClothingOnBody`: For rendering clothing (placeholder)
- `saveARResult`: For saving AR session results
- `isARSupported`: For checking device AR support

### 5. UI Enhancements
The current UI would need to be enhanced with:
- Real-time camera view
- AR overlay for clothing
- Controls for selecting clothing items
- Capture and save functionality
- Loading states for processing

## Future Enhancements
1. **Clothing Database**: Integrate with the existing inventory system to show real clothing items
2. **Social Sharing**: Allow users to share their virtual try-on results
3. **Size Recommendations**: Use body measurements to recommend proper sizes
4. **Multi-user AR**: Allow multiple users to see the same AR scene

## Testing Considerations
1. Test on various device types and camera capabilities
2. Ensure performance is acceptable on mid-range devices
3. Test with different lighting conditions
4. Verify privacy and data handling compliance

## Conclusion
The current implementation provides a foundation for AR integration. To fully implement the virtual try-on functionality, the steps outlined above would need to be completed. The existing utility functions and dependencies provide a good starting point for this work.
